# Bivariate-Poisson-Distribution
The purpose of the analysis is, by applying the Bivariate Poisson Distribution on each one of the 132K footbal matches included in our dataset:

1. to depict, how close the probabilities calculated are to the actual results.
2. to suggest possible ways to correct the outcome.
3. to investigate a scenario of betting on draws with value, after the corrections prediscussed.
